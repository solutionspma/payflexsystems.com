# PayFlex Systems - Investor Memo

**Date:** January 5, 2026

## What We Are

PayFlex Systems is a **verticalized payments infrastructure company**. We operate the rails; clients fund programs. We start with healthcare (PayFlex.Health) and expand into legal (PayFlex.Law).

## Why We Win

- **Non-circumventable rails** (Stripe + Unit under PayFlex control)
- **Recurring platform fees + usage rake**
- **No balance-sheet risk**
- **Multi-vertical expansion without rebuild**

## Revenue Streams

1. **Monthly platform access (MRR)**
2. **Transaction platform fee (bps)**
3. **Card issuance/active fees + interchange share**
4. **Setup fees (optional, strategic)**

## Moat

**Contracts + code + ownership of money movement.**

Once a client launches on PayFlex, they cannot replicate the infrastructure without:
- Stripe account setup
- Unit banking relationships
- Compliance infrastructure
- Card program management
- 24-month non-circumvention clause

## Valuation Snapshot (Conservative)

### Year 1
- 25 clients @ avg $1,200 MRR → **~$360k ARR**

### Year 2
- 75 clients + usage growth → **~$1.4M ARR**

### Multiple
- 6–10× ARR (payments infrastructure comps: Stripe Connect, Unit, Modern Treasury)

### Indicative Value (Y2)
- **$8–14M**

## Unit Economics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| CAC | $2,500 (waived setup + sales) |
| LTV | $50,000+ (3.5yr avg retention) |
| LTV:CAC | 20:1 |
| Gross Margin | 85%+ |

## Competitive Positioning

| Company | Model | Weakness |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Stripe | Processor | No vertical solutions |
| Square | POS + payments | Not infrastructure |
| Sezzle/Affirm | BNPL | They lend (balance-sheet risk) |
| GoHighLevel | Marketing SaaS | Doesn't own money |
| **PayFlex** | **Vertical infra** | **Owns rails + no lending risk** |
