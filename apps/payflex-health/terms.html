        <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using PayFlex Health services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and all applicable laws and regulations. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing this site.</p>

        <h2>2. Use License</h2>
        <p>Permission is granted to temporarily access the materials on PayFlex Health's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title.</p>

        <h2>3. Financing Terms</h2>
        <p>All financing terms, including interest rates, payment schedules, and fees, will be clearly disclosed before you accept any financing agreement. By accepting a financing offer, you agree to repay the financed amount according to the terms specified in your agreement.</p>

        <h2>4. Credit Checks</h2>
        <p>Pre-qualification involves a soft credit inquiry that does not affect your credit score. If you proceed with a financing application, a hard credit inquiry may be performed, which could impact your credit score.</p>

        <h2>5. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of PayFlex Health is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand our practices.</p>

        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with applicable federal and state laws, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that location.</p>
